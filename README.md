# Hi, God Nerfed Me


## 🚀 About Me
My stats were too overpowered so people complained and the developer decided to do something about it. Before the nerf I was a black belt in 50+ programming languages including Python, Javscript, and BrainF*ck. After the nerf I can bearly write English. I'm still a little mad about the whole situation so please don't mention it. 
## What I'm working on
🧠 I'm currently learning full stack web development through https://open.appacademy.io 

👩‍💻 I'm planning on building out https://godnerfed.me but it may be a while before I get it ready for the public.
It's really is just meant to be a sandbox for me to play with new technologies. 

## 🛠 Skills
**Languages:**  Javascript, Python, Ruby

**Server:** Node, Nginx
